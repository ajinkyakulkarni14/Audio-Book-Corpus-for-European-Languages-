# Audio-Book-Corpus-for-European-Languages-# Audio-Book-Corpus
Audio Book Corpus (ABC) project has been developed to aid linguist researchers in the field of text to   speech for purely academic purposes.
In the current form, the corpus consists approximately 200 minutes of speech data in German language. Besides German, we are also in the process of developing Corpus Portuguese and Italian langugae. Future versions of 
the corpus shall encompass most European languages such as French, Spanish, Czech, Dutch, Polish, Romanian.

CORPUS DETAILS

The ABC project consists of three modules. The speech data is in wave file format, taken from Librivox, https://librivox.org/. Librivox provides free audio books on public domain for the academia on linguistic research.

TECHNIQUE FOR ANNOTATION :

After noise removal of audio data, we used semi-annotation based on deep learning and fuzzy matching technique.
This corpus was annotated manually by 20%, and using deep learning techniques, we trained the machine to validate the rest of 80% speech data. In order to complete this, we successfully built a small GUI (python platform) to 
visualize the audio files and annotated text with perfect coherence and match with speech signals.
